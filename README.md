###Kafka Consumer-Producer Pipeline with Spring Boot

This project implements a real-time data processing pipeline using Kafka and Spring Boot. The application consumes messages from an input Kafka topic (user-login), processes each message, and publishes the transformed data to an output Kafka topic (processed-user-login). This pipeline can be useful for scenarios where incoming data needs transformation, aggregation, or filtering before being passed downstream.

Project Setup
To set up the project, you need Docker, Kafka, and Spring Boot installed locally. This setup uses Docker Compose to create a local Kafka environment with the required Kafka broker and Zookeeper services.

Docker Compose File
Include the following docker-compose.yml file in the project root:

version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    ports:
      - 22181:2181
    networks:
      - kafka-network

  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - 9092:9092
      - 29092:29092
    networks:
      - kafka-network
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 0
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: LISTENER_INTERNAL://kafka:9092,LISTENER_EXTERNAL://localhost:29092
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: LISTENER_INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,LISTENER_EXTERNAL:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: LISTENER_INTERNAL
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR: 1

networks:
  kafka-network:
    driver: bridge
This file defines the services required to set up Kafka locally, enabling connections on localhost:29092.

Implementation Details
The application has a single service, KafkaConsumerService, which is responsible for:

Consuming messages from the user-login Kafka topic.
Processing the data by applying a transformation (e.g., converting the message to uppercase).
Publishing the transformed data to a second Kafka topic, processed-user-login.
KafkaConsumerService
Consumer Setup: The consumer connects to the Kafka broker, subscribes to the user-login topic, and continuously polls for messages.

Message Processing: Each consumed message is transformed in the processMessage method. This method can be modified to apply custom transformations or other business logic.

Producer Setup: The processed message is sent to the processed-user-login topic using a Kafka producer. Each message is wrapped in a ProducerRecord and sent to Kafka.

Key Configuration Properties
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: Kafka broker address (localhost:29092 in local setup).
INPUT_TOPIC: Name of the source Kafka topic (user-login).
OUTPUT_TOPIC: Name of the destination Kafka topic for processed data (processed-user-login).
Running the Application Locally
Start Kafka using Docker Compose:

docker-compose up -d
Run the Spring Boot Application: Compile and run the Spring Boot application with your IDE or using Maven:

View Consumed and Processed Messages: The application will log consumed and processed messages to the console.

Production Deployment
To deploy this application in a production environment, follow these steps:

Build a Docker Image: Create a Docker image for the Spring Boot application:

docker build -t kafka-consumer-producer:latest .
Environment Configuration: Set environment variables for Kafka server addresses, topic names, and group IDs as required by the production environment.

Production Docker Compose: Modify docker-compose.yml to include:

Kafka security configurations if applicable (SSL/TLS).
Additional topics and replication configurations for high availability.
Define the network to be production-ready with specific subnets or link configurations.
Logging and Monitoring: Use centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK stack) to monitor application logs. Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to observe Kafka and application metrics.

Deployment: Deploy the Docker image to your cloud or on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Use orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to manage containerized services in production.

Production Changes and Enhancements
Configuration Management: Use a configuration server (like Spring Cloud Config or Consul) to externalize and manage configurations across environments.

Error Handling and Retries: Implement robust error-handling logic to handle transient Kafka issues, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies.

Scalability:

Consumer Groups: Deploy multiple instances of the consumer in the same consumer group to parallelize message consumption.
Horizontal Scaling: Use Kubernetes to scale the service based on load.
Security:

Enable SSL encryption for communication with Kafka brokers.
Configure Kafka authentication using SASL for access control.
Secure environment variables for sensitive data, such as Kafka credentials, using secrets management.
Data Serialization: To optimize performance, consider using a schema registry (e.g., Confluent Schema Registry) and serialize messages using Avro or Protobuf.

Conclusion
This project provides a basic example of a Kafka consumer-producer pipeline. With a few production-level changes, this setup can be used to handle real-time data processing reliably and efficiently in a production environment.
